# 🎉 PrepAI - Complete Upgrade Summary

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Advanced AI Humanization (FIXED!)**
The previous humanizer was showing **97% AI detection**. I've now implemented an **advanced humanization system** that:

  - 30-minute payment expiration
  - Automatic account upgrade after confirmation
  - Clear payment instructions

- ✅ **Pricing Plans:**
  - Monthly: $29.99/month
  - Yearly: $299.99/year (17% discount - save $60!)

### 3. **New Pricing Page**
Beautiful pricing page with:
- ✅ 3 plan tiers (Free, Monthly, Yearly)
- ✅ Feature comparison
- ✅ Crypto and card payment options
- ✅ Animated UI with Framer Motion
- ✅ Responsive design

### 4. **GitHub Repository Setup**

## 🎓 How the Advanced Humanizer Works

### Layer 1: Phrase Replacement
- "Furthermore" → "What's more"
- "Moreover" → "Plus"
- "demonstrates that" → "shows us that"

### Layer 2: Contractions
- "it is" → "it's"
- "cannot" → "can't"
- "they are" → "they're"

### Layer 3: Natural Flow
- Adds occasional transitions
- Varies sentence starters
- Includes natural filler phrases

### Layer 4: Imperfections
- Strategic informality
- Conversational touches
- Human-like variations

**Result:** Text that reads naturally while maintaining academic quality!

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Crypto Wallet Addresses
The current implementation uses placeholder wallet addresses. **Before going live:**

1. Replace with your actual wallet addresses in:
   ```
   app/api/crypto-payment/route.ts
   ```

2. Update the `CRYPTO_WALLETS` object with your real addresses

3. Test with small amounts first

### API Keys
- GitHub token is stored securely
- Database credentials in environment variables
- No sensitive data in repository
